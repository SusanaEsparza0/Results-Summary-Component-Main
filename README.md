## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Desktop


### What I learned

This challenge was interesting, in my job I am rarely tasked with programming the mobile view and it was quite useful for me to understand how to switch from desktop to mobile. It helped me to get used to placing the boxes in a different view.

I tried using <dl> and <dd> in the summary part but, I realised it would be longer code if I tried so, I changed it at the last minute to <div> using classes to make the css part easier.

### Continued development

I still have a lot to learn in CSS so, I will keep practising these challenges in order to get better at basic programming and learn more languages to improve the breakdown of web pages and applications.
